Learning to become a DevOps engineer is increasingly important in
the software development cycle due to the transformative impact it
has on the entire software development and delivery process. DevOps,
which stands for Development and Operations, is a set of practices,
principles, and cultural philosophies aimed at improving collaboration
between software development and IT operations teams. Here are key reasons
why learning DevOps is crucial in today's software development landscape:

1. Enhanced Collaboration: DevOps bridges the traditional gap between
development and operations teams. DevOps engineers facilitate communication
and collaboration, ensuring that both teams work closely together throughout
the software development lifecycle. This collaborative approach leads to
faster development cycles and quicker issue resolution.
